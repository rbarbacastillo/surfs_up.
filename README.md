As a result of the information displayed above, we can notice the following:

* Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, so temperature is not a relevant indicator between these tow periods.
* The maximum temperatures of June and December whow a two degree difference, a difference even lower than than the median.
* The minimum temperature between December (56) and June (64) show a larger difference.

# Summary

Max temperatures and average temperatures show very similar outputs, however minimum temperatures show a significant variance between periods.

The information displayed in our analysis do not make clear how these minimum temperature differences were compensated and our average data could be misleading, further analysis should be performed in order to figure out if the minimum difference is an anomaly or we need to ignore and restate the data for our analysis.
